                            <p>We received the Aquapaw very quickly and was pleased with the adapters it came with. 
                            We hooked it up to our bathtub and it's very convenient switching from our shower head to 
                            the aqua paw.    
                            The only con is the water pressure. I have two German shepherds with lots of hair, 
                            so the weak water pressure made it hard to wash him quickly, 
                            however so perfect for their daily paw washings.

                            <p>Aquapaw makes bath time much easier for both you and your dog. 
                            The quick-attach hose makes for easy assembly, and the hand scrubber leaves your pup clean 
                            as a whistle.</p>

                            <p>We have a 15-pound dog and hooked up the Aquapaw to a shower. Everything worked perfectly - 
                            installation was easy, water pressure is great and, best of all, 
                            it cut bath time in half for our pup. Before Aquapaw, he was nervous to get a bath, but he loved the Aquapaw!</p>

                            <p>This has been one of my best purchases. My dog hates baths, and was always trying to get away from the shower head. 
                            With this, she is so much better. 
                            I love the fact that you can turn of the water supply on the pad, which means the water temperature remains set until you're finished. 
                            Bath time has become so much more pleasant for me and my dog.</p>

                            <p>It's a great product. It's not fancy but still it works very well, I have had it for 2 years now. 
                            I also use it as a hand-held shower for us humans too. 
                            Regardless, the best thing about its intended function is that the water goes straight to the skin, 
                            so you can really rinse and clean the dog's fur properly, and you can rub the animal while it gently showers them, 
                            without splashing the dog or making them afraid. </p>

                            <p>I have a 50 lbs white pit bull. So as you can imagine with her being white, she needs baths fairly regularly. 
                            However she's 50 lbs of "I don't want a bath" dog. This thing has changed that.  
                            There's no more filling the tub or trying to rinse her off with dirty soapy bath water. 
                            It's just in, click - wet, click - soap and scrub, click - rinse, dry and done! 
                            It has reduced her bath time down to only 15 minutes tops. </p>
